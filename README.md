# TOPSIS Algorithm README

## Summary

The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm is a decision-making technique used to determine the best alternative among a set of options based on multiple criteria. It calculates the relative closeness of each alternative to an ideal solution and ranks them accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of the TOPSIS algorithm is to assist in decision-making processes where there are multiple criteria to consider. It helps in selecting the most suitable alternative by evaluating their performance against the ideal solution.

## Calculation Method

1. **Normalization**: Normalize the decision matrix to bring all criteria on the same scale.
2. **Weighted Normalization**: Apply weights to the normalized matrix based on the importance of each criterion.
3. **Ideal Solution Calculation**: Determine the positive ideal solution (for benefit criteria) and negative ideal solution (for cost criteria).
4. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the Euclidean distance of each alternative from the ideal solutions.
5. **Proximity Measure**: Calculate the relative proximity of each alternative to the ideal solutions.
6. **Ranking**: Rank the alternatives based on their proximity measure, with higher values indicating better alternatives.

## Example

Consider a decision matrix D with alternatives A1, A2, A3 and criteria C1, C2, C3, C4:

|       | C1 | C2 | C3  | C4  |
|-------|----|----|-----|-----|
| A1    | 15 | 6  | 25000 | 7  |
| A2    | 12 | 7  | 35000 | 7  |
| A3    | 10 | 9  | 55000 | 8  |

Weights W: [0.3, 0.05, 0.6, 0.05]

1. Normalize matrix D.
2. Apply weights to the normalized matrix to get P.
3. Calculate positive ideal solution A+ and negative ideal solution A-.
4. Compute distances from A+ and A- for each alternative.
5. Calculate the proximity measure for each alternative.
6. Rank the alternatives based on the proximity measure.
